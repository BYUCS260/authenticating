# Lesson 8: What comes next?

Hopefully you were able to learn from this lesson some useful things:

* how to create registration and login endpoints to authenticate users with a username and password,

* how and why to salt and hash passwords,

* how to use cookies to maintain a login over a period of time,

* how to restrict API endpoints to logged in users or to administrative users,

* how to write a script to create an administrative user,

* how to factor your Node.js code into modules to make it easier to maintain,

* how to store data that is linked to a user in Mongo using Mongoose, and

* how to set up different views for when a user is logged in or when a user is an administrative user.

I hope you also see that there is much more we could add to this application. This might include:

* allowing an administrator to create other admins,

* providing for the ability to assign tickets to support staff to handle them,

* providing for more roles, such as support staff who can handle tickets but not assign them,

* creating a chain of replies for tickets, so users and staff can have a dialogue about an issue,

* providing other types of status for a ticket, such as assigned or in progress,

* allowing staff to directly change the status of a ticket,

* including email functionality on the back end to let admins know when new tickets are created, or

* providing paid accounts that get priority access to added features.

There is so much more you can do to create a more full-featured web application.
